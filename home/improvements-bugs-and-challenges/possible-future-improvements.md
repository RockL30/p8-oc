# Possible Future Improvements

* Refactor app to an React / Redux App, making the app more maintanable, clean and faster
* Create new styles with [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [daisy.ui](https://daisyui.com/), or material UI
* Create App framework with [codux](https://www.codux.com/)
* Document logic frameworks with [https://code2flow.com/](https://code2flow.com/) or just [Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software)
* Create tests with Cypress

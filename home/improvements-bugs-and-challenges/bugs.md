addditem

in js/controller.js, we changed the addditem to additem

Todo IDs

In the js/store.js file, we modified the way the ID was generated to be more unique with date.

removeItem

in js/controller.js, we simplified the removeItem

The second version of the code is more simple, direct and removes the unnecessary iteration and logging by directly calling the method on the model with the given `id`.&#x20;

\
Once the item is removed from the model, the UI is updated by calling the `render` method on the view , then after updating the UI, it calls the `_filter` method to re-apply any filters that might have been applied previously.
